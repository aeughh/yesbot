dont ask about the commit changes this isnt a trojan


## To make life easier, heres some tips that I have noticed
~the names of message parameters using things like .addStringOption cannot contain capital letters
~rTo add more commands, add a new command into the commands folder, then in the shell type "node deploycommands.js" This will register all commands located in subdirectories of the command folder. Always rerun the shell command every time you add a new command.
